Understanding user needs and turning them into a functional program starts with gathering requirements and creating user stories that break down features in a simple, user-focused way. User stories help keep the development process clear and manageable by focusing on what the user wants and why it matters. When developing software, I prefer an Agile approach, working in sprints to build and improve the program step by step. I also want to incorporate Scrum practices, Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure quality, and Continuous Integration (CI/CD) to streamline updates. Being a good team member means communicating clearly, collaborating with others, and staying open to feedback, all while following Agile processes like stand-ups and sprint planning. Good teamwork and adaptability help keep projects on track and ensure that the final product meets user needs. By following these principles, I can contribute to building high-quality, user-friendly software while working efficiently with my team.
